# Ghaith Platform

## About the Project

"Ghaith" is a comprehensive charity platform designed to connect those in need with generous donors and volunteers. Users can explore a diverse range of charitable organizations, each with its own mission and impact. Through the platform, users can donate directly to charities or contribute to specific cases that resonate with them.

Additionally, "Ghaith" offers a platform for individuals to request assistance, whether it's for basic needs or specific challenges they are facing. Users can also request pickups for donated items, making it convenient to contribute clothing, food, and other essentials to those in need.

For those looking to make a difference beyond monetary donations, "Ghaith" provides information on events organized by charities, allowing users to volunteer their time and support meaningful causes in their communities.

Behind the scenes, the admin dashboard empowers administrators to manage requests, cases, and charities efficiently, ensuring that "Ghaith" operates smoothly and effectively to serve its noble purpose.
